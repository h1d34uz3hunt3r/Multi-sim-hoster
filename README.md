Multi-sim hoster takes tributes from a 4chan thread and loads them into one of three simulators with a click. Based on and inspired by [Virginia's Hunger Games Script](https://github.com/zmnmxlntr/hg/tree/master).

Supports:  
[Brant Steele's Original Hunger Games](https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/reaping.php) (The old sim)  
[Brant Steele's Experimental Hunger Games](https://brantsteele.com/hungergames/classic/reaping.php) (The new sim)  
[Orteil's Murder Games](https://orteil.dashnet.org/murdergames/)

# How to use it
Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the controls. Change the mode to the simulator you want to host for.  
![Mode selection](https://github.com/h1d34uz3hunt3r/Multi-sim-hoster/blob/main/Examples/ModeSelect.png)

Click "Draw". Deselect entries you don't want included by unchecking the checkbox in the top left. Or click "Deselect All" to deselect all entries. Entries that are posted after you draw won't be included, you can click "Draw" again to include them.  
![Select deselect](https://github.com/h1d34uz3hunt3r/Multi-sim-hoster/blob/main/Examples/SelectDeselect.gif)  

For simulators that support teams, you can enter the team name and team color. When an entry specifies a new team, click the Set Team checkbox beside the team name, then click "Draw" again. All entries below that will autofill to the first set team contained in that post (the color autofills as well).

Click "Save". Go to the simulator of your choice.  
For the old sim and the new sim, go to the edit page and click "load" (hit "rolling load" if you want tributes to loop until the end of the form). Then scroll to the bottom of the form and hit "submit".  
For Murder Games, just hit "load".
